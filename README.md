Find-S Algorithm Implementation, Experiments, and Analysis

# Instructions to run our program from the terminal
# python find_s.py 
This command outputs the trace of the EnjoySport example from class
# python generator.py
This command runs the 100 experiments that count how many randomly generated training examples it takes to achieve the target concept of <Sunny, Warm, ?, ?, ?, ?>. It outputs an array of the number of training examples needed for each experiment.

# Description of included files
